## Best Practice - Coding Style

A style guide is about consistency.
- Consistency with [a] style guide is important.
- Consistency within a project is more important.
- Consistency within one module or function is the most important.

Having code with inconsistent coding style makes it hard for humans to focus on how and what the code is doing.
In particular, when (not if) you come back to debug or further develop your code, you'll have forgotten the details of what was done.
For this reason you should write code in as easy to understand way as possible.


Why care about style?
- provides consistency
- makes code easier to read
- makes code easier to write
- makes it easier to collaborate


Have you tried to read Shakespeare?
How much of a mental load was it to try and understand the characters and stories simply because the language was so different from our every day?
Now imagine that you 'get in the groove' with his style, and now have to start reading works by another author who as a different (but still strange) language choice.
You have to spend a significant amount of effort learning the new style before you can even analyze the themes of their work!

Do yourself a favour and be clear, consistent, and concise, whenever possible.
Even better, have a look at how other people code, and learn from their best practices.
[PEP8 style guide](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) is essentially a summary of these practices as relating to coding style.
	
Because programmers will automate anything they can, there are a programs written to analyse the style of your code, and point out where you deviate from a given style guide.
For example, `pylint` will give you a summary of where your code doesn't conform to the PEP8 standard.

If we apply `pylint` to our proof of concept code we'll get a bunch of notices:

Thats a fairly poor rating, but then again, the code isn't very well structured, mostly because our main goal was making things work.
Each of the lines that have been identified come with an error code which you can get more information from `pytlint`:

## Structuring and styling our code

Let's take a look at our proof of concept code and point out some of the things we are doing that make it hard for us to read, and might be causing problems in the future.
I've interspersed the code with comments that come from pylint:

ras = []

Notice that `pylint` *really* doesn't like lines like `from math import *`.

## DRY coding principle

Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY), means not having (near) identical blocks of code throughout your program.
Repeated code means repeated bugs, multiple places for the one bug to occur.
If you need to do the same thing more than once, then write a function and call it.
If there is a bug in the code then at least it's only in one place!

Next level, is to not repeat yourself across multiple projects.
This means writing your code as class/functions and then `import`ing that code when you need it.
Next level is to provide a package/module with all these helpful bits of code.

Related to DRY is the DRO principle of Don't Repeat Others, or simply don't re-invent the wheel.
There is a lot of already existing code available that will probably do most of what you need.
Instead of remaking a solution from scratch (and having to test/debug/maintain it) you should just `pip install` the package that does what you need.
Have a look on [pypi.org](https://pypi.org/) for packages of interest, or ask your colleagues, or [stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/).

### Structuring code

At a high level python files should have the following content / order:
- a `#!` line like `#! /usr/bin/env python` on the first line
- a docstring for this module (if it's a module, see [later]({{page.root}}{% link _episodes/Documentation.md %}))
- `import` all the modules/clasess/functions that you need (and no more)
- global (static) variables
- define classes
- define functions
- a `main()` function if you use one
- an `if __name__` clause if you want one

Notice that the above leaves almost no code in the global scope.
This is a good thing, it helps us keep our different parts of code from interfering with each other.
If we reuse variable names and forget to set/reset the value of that variable then we get bugs, by keeping our code within functions and classes then we can avoid this common source of bugs.

Let's revisit our proof of concept code and apply the above structure.

> ## Use functions
> - Update POC to use two functions: one to generate the positions, and one to save them to a file
> - Have a very short "main" clause to run the code.
> - `git commit` with a useful message when you are done

## Acknowledgement of country
We wish to acknowledge the custodians of the land we reside on. For the developers of these lessons, these are the Wadjuk (Perth region) people of the Nyoongar nation. This workshop will be delivered on the lands of the Bedegal people.
We pay our respect to their Elders and acknowledge their continuing culture and the contribution they make to the life of our cities and regions. 


## Overview
This training was developed by [ADACS](https://adacs.org.au) at the request of Caroline Foster as part of their 2023A training project.

This workshop is intended for researchers who have little or no formal computing training, but who have learned to get by via self or peer learning, and who are interested to being exposed to some best practices in computing and software development.

This workshop has been developed in the style of Carpentries (hence the site layout) but is not an official Carpentries lesson.
Some of the content is intended for learners to read, think, and ask questions, some of it will require learners to write code or use the HPC facility for themselves, and other parts will be treated as a discussion session where no or little computing interaction will be needed.

## Required software / services
You will need:
- Access to Teams/Zoom video conferencing system (for remote participants, depending on which works on the day!)
- A bash terminal
- An account on NCI  (see below)
- A zest for life

See instructions on the [home page]({{page.root}}#Setup)

### An account on NCI
You will need to have an account on the National Compute Infrastructure (NCI) in order to complete some of the exercises for this course.
See [these instructions](https://my.nci.org.au/mancini/signup/0) for how you can obtain an account.

Once you have an account you'll need to join the group FIXME.
